Hello! I'm Federico, a physicist from Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·. I created this blog as a space to explore and showcase my data visualisation and analysis projects, which I work on in my free time.

Rather than rigorous essays, this blog is a collection of exercises in data visualisation, focusing on creative and insightful ways to present information. I cover a wide range of topics, including politics, literature, nature, music, and video games.

My goal is to experiment, learn, and share insights with others who enjoy working with data. Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to reach out with feedback!
