title: Visualising Recent Earthquakes
---

I recently came across [a compelling visualisation](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1jodbwe/oc_strongest_earthquakes_in_the_past_three_decades/) on Reddit that highlighted the strongest earthquakes of the past three decades. Inspired by it, I decided to create a similar visualisation focused on a different metric.

The chart below illustrates the deadliest earthquake each year since 2001. The main axes represent the year and earthquake depth (in kilometers). The diameter of each marker is proportional to the square root of the number of fatalities, while the color corresponds to the earthquakeâ€™s magnitude. Flags indicate the location of each event, and detailed information is available by hovering over the markers.

Please note that data for the [2025 Myanmar earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake) is still being updated.
