title: Dungeons & Monsters

[*Dungeons & Dragons*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) is a tabletop role-playing game that has grown in popularity in recent years. In this fantasy world, heroic adventurers face off against a wide variety of monsters.

In this post, I explore several visualizations of monsters featured in the [System Reference Document 5.1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/srd).

Each monster is described by a *stat block*, which includes a set of numerical attributes that define its characteristicsâ€”such as speed, hit points (the amount of damage it can sustain before dying), strength, size, type, dexterity, and more.

One of the most important statistics is the *Challenge Rating* (CR), which indicates how difficult a monster is for a party of player characters. The higher the CR, the tougher the monster. CR values range from 0, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, and continue up to 30.

In the following visualization, each point represents a monster, grouped into "buckets" based on its CR.

    {% include dnd-monsters/monster_cr.html %}

We can also explore how monsters are distributed by type...

...and by size.

    {% include dnd-monsters/monster_cr_by_size.html %}
</div>

In addition, every monster has ability scores across six core attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. These can be visualized using the following radar chart.

    The dataset and the Python scripts used to generate the visualisation are available on the associated <a href="https://github.com/ffiza/dnd-monsters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository</a>.
